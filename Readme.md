# Boston market AirBNB Analysis
 The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to a successful Airbnb listing in Boston, as well as to uncover the reasons behind negative reviews.

## Project Intro/Objective
Using the rich kaggle dataset provided by [Inside Airbnb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston), which includes detailed information on listings, such as property characteristics, amenities, neighborhood details, and guest reviews, we aim to dissect what makes an Airbnb stay in Boston delightful or disappointing. Through the application of the CRISP-DM methodology and a variety of machine learning techniques, we delve into the nuances of guest experiences and listing success factors.

Our analysis is structured around three key questions:

- Does the "superhost" status enhance the guest experience from a traveler's perspective?
- From an investor's standpoint, which features are most influential in determining the success of an Airbnb listing?
- What are the primary reasons guests leave negative reviews?

By answering these questions, this project aims to provide actionable insights for both Airbnb hosts looking to improve their offerings and travelers seeking the best possible lodging experiences in Boston.
