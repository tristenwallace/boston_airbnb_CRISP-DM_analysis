    "\n",
    "- For the second question (Q2) about how popular or full places are, I would like to use price and occupancy to compare success by total revenue, but occupancy isn't tracked. Thankfully, Inside Airbnb has already looked into the issue of modeling occupancy and suggest using \"a Review Rate of 50%\" to approximate bookings from the number of reviews. So, I'm going to use the **\"_reviews_per_month\"** column to estimate of how many times a place gets booked to gauge a listing's success.\n",
