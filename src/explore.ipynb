    "After going through the [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit?usp=sharing) provided by [Insider Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/data-assumptions) , I got a clearer picture of the dataset and picked out the key features I'll need for answering our main questions.\n",

    "- The calendar dataset shows prices and availability for listings for the next year. It's more about what hosts plan to do in the future, so I'm skipping this data for my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the listings dataset, there's a lot of info about what each lisitng offers. The column **\"_host_issuperhost\"** will be useful in answering the first question (Q1).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reviews dataset provides customer comments and the dates they were left. I can model the sentiment of these reviews to help answer the third question (Q3). There are also 7 **\"review_scores\"** metrics within the listings dataset that will be helpful for the third question (Q3)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the second question (Q2) about how popular or full places are, I would like to use price and occupancy to compare success by total revenue, but occupancy isn't tracked. Thankfully, Inside Airbnb has already looked into the issue of modeling occupancy and suggest using \"a Review Rate of 50%\" to approximate bookings from the number of reviews. So, I'm going to use the **\"_reviews_per_month\"** column to estimate of how many times a place gets booked to gauge a listing's success.\n",
